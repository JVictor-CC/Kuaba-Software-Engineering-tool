# Kuaba-Software-Engineering-tool
This repository contains artifacts related to the development of the Kuaba Software Engineering (KSE) tool. 

KSE uses the Kuaba approach to support the design rationale record during software modeling. This tool automatically generates representations of design rationale from the UML metamodel as designers draw their diagrams. KSE also has functionality that supports the reuse of software design. This reuse is achieved through computational processing of design rationale representations to generate a new UML diagram.
